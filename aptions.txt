cookies 

	and they are SUPER SECURE!!!
	Distant voice: But cookies are also accessible through javascript.
	That’s true, but only if the server doesn’t set the HttpOnly flag

	Distant voice: Of course not, what if someone sents them through a non-secure HTTP request?
	
	CSRF attack?
	A CSRF attack is performed when an attacker takes advantage of the browser’s default behavior, 
	to send all cookies even on cross-domain requests.
	
	Example : The attacker sends an email with a beautiful offer, and adds a CTA button at the end, “GET A 50% DISCOUNT”.
	The user is thrilled by this awesome offer and clicks the button.
	In reality, the button submits a POST form to your web application, 
	and more specifically to the endpoint that changes the user’s password with a new one.
	Because cookies are sent in every request, even cross-domain ones, 
	the endpoint works as expected if the user has logged in, in an earlier step to your web application.
	Now the user is logged out and cannot log in to your web application anymore.


Content Security Policy (CSP):
	is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, 
	including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft, 
	to site defacement, to malware distribution.
